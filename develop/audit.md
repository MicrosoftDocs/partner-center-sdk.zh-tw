# <a name="audit-operations"></a>Audit operations

The Partner Center APIs provide auditing features so you can get a record of Partner Center activity.

You can retrieve audit records for the previous 30 days from the current date, or for a date range specified by including the start date and/or the end date. Note, however, that for performance reasons activity log data availability is limited to the previous 90 days. Requests with a start date greater than 90 days prior to the current date will receive a bad request exception (error code: 400) and an appropriate message.
