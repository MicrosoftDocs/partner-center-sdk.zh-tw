*Except for bug fixes, this API is no longer being updated.* You should update your applications to call the **onetime** API instead of **marketplace**. The **onetime** API provides additional functionality, and will continue to be updated.

You should use **onetime** to query all commercial consumption line items instead of **marketplace**. Or, you can follow the links in the estimate links call.
